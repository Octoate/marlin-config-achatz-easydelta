# Marlin firmware configuration for the Achatz easyDelta 3D printer

This repository contains the configuration files for the [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) 3D printer firmware. I am currently using this files to configure the latest Marlin and calibrate my easyDelta with it. If you have any suggestions on how to improve the setup, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull-request.

__NOTE: The current configuration files are for Marlin v1.0.2. I will try to update it soon.__

# Installation

The installation of the configuration is rather simple. Just clone the original Marlin firmware repository and copy the configuration files over to it. Compile the sources with the latest Arduino IDE and upload it to the printer. Afterwards recalibrate your printer.
